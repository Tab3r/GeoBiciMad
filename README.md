Stupid and simple REST service, that converts Simple JSON from BiciMad service (http://www.bicimad.com/)  to a standard GeoJSON file

The path is in : /GeoBiciMad/rest/geojson

Note: NO caches the json recieved from BiciMad. Not overload their servers, be kind!!!


Required

* JBoss...
* Developed in Jboss Development Studio (If you will use Eclipse has to work fine with the correct plugins... i don't know which ones!!!)
