What is it?
-----------

Stupid and simple REST service, that converts Simple JSON from BiciMad service (http://www.bicimad.com/)  to a standard GeoJSON file

The path is in : /GeoBiciMad/rest/geojson
A map example page is created in: /GeoBiciMad/index.html

Note: NO caches the json recieved from BiciMad. Not overload their servers, be kind!!!


Required
---------
* JBoss...
* Developed in Jboss Development Studio (If you will use Eclipse has to work fine with the correct plugins... i don't know which ones!!!)


Thanks to:
----------
* Openlayers -> "http://openlayers.org/"
* Map icons collection -> "http://mapicons.nicolasmollet.com/" used in example page.
